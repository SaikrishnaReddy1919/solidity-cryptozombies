## Internal and External

In addition to public and private, Solidity has two more types of visibility for functions: internal and external.

internal is the same as private, except that it's also accessible to contracts that inherit from this contract. (Hey, that sounds like what we want here!).

external is similar to public, except that these functions can ONLY be called outside the contract — they can't be called by other functions inside that contract. We'll talk about why you might want to use external vs public later.

## Gas — the fuel Ethereum DApps run on

In Solidity, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called gas. Users buy gas with Ether (the currency on Ethereum), so your users have to spend ETH in order to execute functions on your DApp.

How much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex that function's logic is. Each individual operation has a gas cost based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total gas cost of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.

Because running functions costs real money for your users, code optimization is much more important in Ethereum than in other programming languages. If your code is sloppy, your users are going to have to pay a premium to execute your functions — and this could add up to millions of dollars in unnecessary fees across thousands of users.

## Why is gas necessary?

Ethereum is like a big, slow, but extremely secure computer. When you execute a function, every single node on the network needs to run that same function to verify its output — thousands of nodes verifying every function execution is what makes Ethereum decentralized, and its data immutable and censorship-resistant.

The creators of Ethereum wanted to make sure someone couldn't clog up the network with an infinite loop, or hog all the network resources with really intensive computations. So they made it so transactions aren't free, and users have to pay for computation time as well as storage.

## View functions don't cost gas

view functions don't cost any gas when they're called externally by a user.

This is because view functions don't actually change anything on the blockchain – they only read the data. So marking a function with view tells web3.js that it only needs to query your local Ethereum node to run the function, and it doesn't actually have to create a transaction on the blockchain (which would need to be run on every single node, and cost gas).

We'll cover setting up web3.js with your own node later. But for now the big takeaway is that you can optimize your DApp's gas usage for your users by using read-only external view functions wherever possible.

Note: If a view function is called internally from another function in the same contract that is not a view function, it will still cost gas. This is because the other function creates a transaction on Ethereum, and will still need to be verified from every node. So view functions are only free when they're called externally.

## MODIFIERS:

We have visibility modifiers that control when and where the function can be called from: private means it's only callable from other functions inside the contract; internal is like private but can also be called by contracts that inherit from this one; external can only be called outside the contract; and finally public can be called anywhere, both internally and externally.

We also have state modifiers, which tell us how the function interacts with the BlockChain: view tells us that by running the function, no data will be saved/changed. pure tells us that not only does the function not save any data to the blockchain, but it also doesn't read any data from the blockchain. Both of these don't cost any gas to call if they're called externally from outside the contract (but they do cost gas if called internally by another function).

Then we have custom modifiers, which we learned about in Lesson 3: onlyOwner and aboveLevel, for example. For these we can define custom logic to determine how they affect a function.

## The payable Modifier

payable functions are part of what makes Solidity and Ethereum so cool — they are a special type of function that can receive Ether.

Let that sink in for a minute. When you call an API function on a normal web server, you can't send US dollars along with your function call — nor can you send Bitcoin.

But in Ethereum, because both the money (Ether), the data (transaction payload), and the contract code itself all live on Ethereum, it's possible for you to call a function and pay money to the contract at the same time.

This allows for some really interesting logic, like requiring a certain payment to the contract in order to execute a function.

## Random number generation via keccak256
The best source of randomness we have in Solidity is the keccak256 hash function.

We could do something like the following to generate a random number:

### Generate a random number between 1 and 100:
```uint randNonce = 0;
uint random = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(now, msg.sender, randNonce))) % 100;
randNonce++;
uint random2 = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(now, msg.sender, randNonce))) % 100;
```

What this would do is take the timestamp of now, the msg.sender, and an incrementing nonce (a number that is only ever used once, so we don't run the same hash function with the same input parameters twice).

It would then "pack" the inputs and use keccak to convert them to a random hash. Next, it would convert that hash to a uint, and then use % 100 to take only the last 2 digits. This will give us a totally random number between 0 and 99.

### This method is vulnerable to attack by a dishonest node
In Ethereum, when you call a function on a contract, you broadcast it to a node or nodes on the network as a transaction. The nodes on the network then collect a bunch of transactions, try to be the first to solve a computationally-intensive mathematical problem as a "Proof of Work", and then publish that group of transactions along with their Proof of Work (PoW) as a block to the rest of the network.

Once a node has solved the PoW, the other nodes stop trying to solve the PoW, verify that the other node's list of transactions are valid, and then accept the block and move on to trying to solve the next block.

This makes our random number function exploitable.

Let's say we had a coin flip contract — heads you double your money, tails you lose everything. Let's say it used the above random function to determine heads or tails. (random >= 50 is heads, random < 50 is tails).

If I were running a node, I could publish a transaction only to my own node and not share it. I could then run the coin flip function to see if I won — and if I lost, choose not to include that transaction in the next block I'm solving. I could keep doing this indefinitely until I finally won the coin flip and solved the next block, and profit.

### So how do we generate random numbers safely in Ethereum?
Because the entire contents of the blockchain are visible to all participants, this is a hard problem, and its solution is beyond the scope of this tutorial. You can read this [StackOverflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/191/how-can-i-securely-generate-a-random-number-in-my-smart-contract) thread for some ideas. One idea would be to use an oracle to access a random number function from outside of the Ethereum blockchain.

Of course, since tens of thousands of Ethereum nodes on the network are competing to solve the next block, my odds of solving the next block are extremely low. It would take me a lot of time or computing resources to exploit this profitably — but if the reward were high enough (like if I could bet $100,000,000 on the coin flip function), it would be worth it for me to attack.

So while this random number generation is NOT secure on Ethereum, in practice unless our random function has a lot of money on the line, the users of your game likely won't have enough resources to attack it.

Because we're just building a simple game for demo purposes in this tutorial and there's no real money on the line, we're going to accept the tradeoffs of using a random number generator that is simple to implement, knowing that it isn't totally secure.
